My research leverages a range of quantitative methods to better understand the biology of infectious diseases and improve our predictions of future outbreaks. My interests include the **community ecology and cross-scale dynamics of respriatory viruses**, such as the implications of virus-virus interactions for coexistence and population dynamics. In parallel, my work advances **real-time predictability of respiratory virus burden**. As a member of the [US Scenario Modeling Hub](https://scenariomodelinghub.org), I develop new methods to improve multi-model scenario projections that inform public health decision making in real time.

Beyond research, I am passionate about teaching mathematics to biology students and developing student confidence in their mathematical abilities.
